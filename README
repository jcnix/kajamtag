Sorry about lacking good documentation on how to use this library.
There is a sample C program and Makefile in example/, which I will try keeping up to date.
When the API gets more stable, I'll write some proper documentation.  I don't have any desire to make huge changes to the documentation right now.

To install:
./autogen.sh
make
make install

This places some header files in /usr/include/kajamtag, and places a shared library in /usr/lib named libkajamtag.so

To link against libkajamtag.so, append -lkajamtag to your gcc compile line.

C++ and Python bindings will be coming eventually.
