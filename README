To install:
./configure
make
make install

This places some header files in /usr/include/kajamtag, and places a shared library in /usr/lib named libkajamtag.so

To link against libkajamtag.so, append -lkajamtag to your gcc compile line.

There is a sample C program and Makefile in example/

C++ and Python bindings will be coming eventually.
